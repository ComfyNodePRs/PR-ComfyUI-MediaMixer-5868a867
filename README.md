### Video Merge Node

The Video Merge node allows you to combine two video clips within ComfyUI.
Plug the input video into "Video_A" and your output render into "Video_B" to combine your extended video.

### Final & First Frame Selector

Final Frame Selector takes an image sequence or video and passes through the final frame as an image node. 
This works great for extending video with image-to-video tools like Pyramid-Flow, CogVideoX, and LTX-Video. <br>
<br>
First Frame Selector will do the same but with the first frame, this was a requested node.
