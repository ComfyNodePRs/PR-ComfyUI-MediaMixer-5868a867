First nodes added to this tooklit are Final Frame Selector and Video Merge.

Final Frame Selector takes an image sequence or video and passes through the final frame as an image node. 
This works great for extending video with image-to-video tools like Pyramid-Flow. 

The Video Merge node allows you to combine two video clips within ComfyUI.
Plug the input video into "Video_A" and your output render into "Video_B" to combine your extended video.
